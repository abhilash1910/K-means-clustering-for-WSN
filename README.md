# K-means-clustering-for-WSN
CPP code for K means clustering for wireless sensor networks which are to be applied to  optimal path to sink algorithm. 
The repository contains the optimised approach to WSN sink algorithms .It uses k means which uses an unsupervised machine learning model which provides heuristic advantage over grid based system.The value of k changes the rate of efficiency of the model.
Validity of Euler path in the circuit for optimal seek time and movement of head/collector.
Scope for further optimisation algorithms.
